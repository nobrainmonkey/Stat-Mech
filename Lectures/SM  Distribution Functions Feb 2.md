## Distribution Functions
Start with $Z(T,V,\mu)$. Want to derive for Fermions

$\langle N \rangle= \sum_i \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\epsilon_i -\mu)}+1}$ \
two ways to go about this
* Harmonic Oscillator
* Box

Derivation online (Feb 2 Notes) \
Same as Schroeder pp. 315 Eq [7.121] ??? 



## logistics
* take a look on Canvas Discussions: *Degeneracy of Fermions* 
* Jan 24 notes uploaded 
* Quantum Ideal Gas notes are uploaded



## Box
* Example Fermions
  * electrons in metals
  * 1/2 integer atom or molecule 
  * neutrons in eutron stars
  
temperature is zero 
  
$H = \sum_i^N \frac{\hat{p_i}^2}{2m} \rightarrow E = \sum_{\vec{k}}\epsilon_{\vec{k}}$ where $i$ labels for a particle

single particle energies $\epsilon_{\vec{k}} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$, $\psi_{\vec{k}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}}e^{i\vec{k}\cdot{\vec{r}}}$

wavevector $\vec{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)$, momentum carried by wave is $\vec{p} = \hbar \vec{k}$

## Fuck this just read chapter 7.3
we talked about 
* Fermi Energy (Schroeder pp 272-288) $\epsilon_F$
* Average Energy per Particle $\frac{U(T=0)}{N}=\frac{3}{5}\epsilon_F$
$$* Also probably covered chapter 7.3 section "small nonzero temperature"
